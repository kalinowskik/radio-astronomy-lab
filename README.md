Selected reports from my radio astronomy lab (written in Polish)

## 1. Calibrating a Radio Telescope
Radio astronomy observations and analysis of the obtained data led to the determination of noise fluctuations, sensitivity of the antenna-radiometer system, antenna temperature and radiometer temperature.
## 2. Assesment of the Antenna's Performance
Radio astronomy observations of Cassiopeia A and the analysis of the obtained data led to the determination of the resolving power, effective area, solid angle, antenna area factor, telescope sensitivity and main lobe efficiency of the radio telescope used.
## 5. Calibrating a Radio Telescope: part 2
Analysis of the calibrator map in the $B=8{,}46\mathrm{GHz}$ band from the Effelsberg radio telescope led to the determination of the calibration factor for the DLA-3C286 source.
## 6. Flux Distribution of NGC6048 Radio Galaxy
The analysis of the maps of the 4C70.19 radio source from the NGC6048 galaxy in the $B=8{,}46\mathrm{\,GHz}$ band from the Effelsberg radio telescope led to the determination of its flux distribution.
## 7. Polarised Flux Distribution of NGC6048 Radio Galaxy
The analysis of the maps of the 4C70.19 radio source from the NGC6048 galaxy in the $B=8{,}46\mathrm{GHz}$ band from the Effelsberg radio telescope led to the determination of its polarized flux distribution and polarization angles.
## Bonus: Multi-Wavelength Analysis of the Radio Galaxy 3C326
The analysis of 3 observations of 3C326 carried out at different wavelengths led to the determination of contour maps, noise and flux measurements, and determination of the spectral index.
