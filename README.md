Selected reports from my radio astronomy lab (written in Polish)

## 1
Radio astronomy observations and analysis of the obtained data led to the determination of noise fluctuations, sensitivity of the antenna-radiometer system, antenna temperature and radiometer temperature.
## 2
Radio astronomy observations of Cassiopeia A and the analysis of the obtained data led to the determination of the resolving power, effective area, solid angle, antenna area factor, telescope sensitivity and main lobe efficiency of the radio telescope used.
## 5
Analysis of the calibrator map in the $B=8{,}46\mathrm{GHz}$ band from the Effelsberg radio telescope led to the determination of the calibration factor for the DLA-3C286 source.
## 6
The analysis of the maps of the 4C70.19 radio source from the NGC6048 galaxy in the $B=8{,}46\mathrm{\,GHz}$ band from the Effelsberg radio telescope led to the determination of its flux distribution.
## 7
The analysis of the maps of the 4C70.19 radio source from the NGC6048 galaxy in the $B=8{,}46\mathrm{GHz}$ band from the Effelsberg radio telescope led to the determination of its polarized flux distribution and polarization angles.
## Bonus
The analysis of 3 observations of 3C326 carried out at different wavelengths led to the determination of contour maps, noise and flux measurements, and determination of the spectral index.
